# GEOG 676: GIS PROGRAMMING


Welcome to GEOG 676: GIS PROGRAMMING. This course introduces current developments in GIS development. By utilizing ESRI's arcpy Python module, students will learn basic GIS programming using an industry standard. The lectures will focus on presenting code, methods, and theory of GIS development as well as errors and challenges one may face while programming. These may include focus on incorporating new features into a script such as querying a SQL table, publishing to Portal, or automatically setting up your work environment. 
>
There are no labs but there are in-class tutorials  which you are expected to work through. There are also homework assignments that should be finished before arriving to class the following week. For questions, please use the Canvas discussion boards as your first option so that your questions/answers can help other students with the same issues. Your instructor will closely follow these discussion boards, and will post responses there.
